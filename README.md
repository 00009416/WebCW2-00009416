--- project structure

app.js - is a name of the folder which same as the name of your project

package.json - the name of the file is [app.js] 

.gitignore - project configuration file is initiated with [npm init]

/node_modules - /node_modules is included to folder to this file. The [node_modules] is not uploaded
folder itself is uploaded to Intranet.

/public - this folder is required for dependencies. So I not changed the name of the folder

/images
 /javascripts -- public folder is needed for me to keep the files essential for building user-interface (client-side)
 /styles
 style.css

/routes
 index.js
 users.js --    route files includes controllers/handlers for specific route groups. Route names that are indicated 			   and I named my route files depending on the context


/views
index.pug
layout.pug -- [views] name for the ‘templates’ folder is expected so I included it.
